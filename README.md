# chord3
Chord3 takes a (set of) chopro file(s) and converts them to a single
pdf file.  If no file names are given as arguments, a single chopro
files is read from standard input.  Chopro files is simply text files
with chord names in brackets and some other options in braces, on
separate lines.

Chord3 is still in early development.  An earlier project, in another
language with other dependencies, may be more useful:
